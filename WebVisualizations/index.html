            <p class="lead">What's the weather like as you get closer to the equator? It seems like a simple question, but the purpose 
                of this project was to prove what seems to be the obvious answer: gross.
            </p>
            <p>To acomplish this analysis, data was pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities at various
                distances from the equator. Once the data was assembled, matplotlib was utilized to plot various aspects of the weather, inlcuding
                temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity against latitude. Along with the source data, this site provides visualizations 
                created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations observed.
